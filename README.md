A sleek Todo application created by **Viktor Rudi** in the summer of 2019.

This is a fully functional **MERN** (Mongodb, Express, React, Node.JS) full stack application.

Frontend built using **React** 16.8, by taking advantage of the Context API and hooks.
Backend built using **Express**, with set up API routes for handling requests in the application.

In this applicaton you will be able to register user accounts (with a visual input verification), and login to create private todo items and folders. You can also reset your password.

> Backend: `bcrypt`, `dotenv`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, `nodemon`, `nodemailer`

> Eslint: Used [Standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard) configuration.
